# Fantas, Eel, and Specification

Hello, friends! If you're reading this, I'm either in the process of writing - or have finished writing - a series of **blog posts** on the Fantasy Land specification for typeclasses in JavaScript - hooray!

The thing is that a lot of these typeclasses are going to be _pretty weird_ if you're coming from a different paradigm, so it's probably going to be helpful to have some examples. With that in mind, I'm going to fill this repo with exactly that, and refer to it whenever I get stuck.

Enjoy!
